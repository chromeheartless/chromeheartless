I am also really, and I mean **really** creative, I love designing stuff in PhotoShop or GIMP, and just doing drawings and sketches all together.

I also dabble into music production, and my favourite artists include smokedope2016, Nettspend, Osamason, Xaviersobased and others. I am **absolutely cracked** at Fl Studio.

### Ideologies and Beliefs.

I lean towards Nihilism;
```
Nihilism is a family of philosophical views arguing that life is meaningless, that moral values are baseless, or that knowledge is impossible. Thus, such views reject the basis of certain ideas. 
```
I am not concerned of your gender, religion, beleifs and opinoions, as long as you aren't a dickhead or try to force anything on me, you are welcome. Feel free to send me a message.
